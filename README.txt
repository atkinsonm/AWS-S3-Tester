********************************************************
This is a program for testing functions of Amazon S3
using the Amazon SDK for Java.

This program was archived with an Apache Ant buildfile. 
If you have ant installed, all you need to do is type
'ant run'
at the command prompt.

This program also includes a pom.xml file. You can
use Apache Maven to run the program. 

The buildfile assumes you are using AWS SDK for Java 
version 1.9.20.1. If you are using a different 
version, please make the change in the build file 
before executing. 

If you don't have Ant or Maven installed,
you will need to set up the classpath yourself,
making sure to include all the jars in the SDK,
including third-party jars.
